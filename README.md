# StreamSound - Apple Watch YouTube Audio Player

A personal Apple Watch app for streaming YouTube audio content during workouts, runs, or any activity where you want hands-free audio playback.

## Features

### ðŸŽµ Audio Streaming

- **Stream YouTube audio directly** - No downloads required, streams in real-time
- **Background playback** - Audio continues playing when screen is off or app is backgrounded
- **Custom seek controls** - Tap or drag to jump to any position in the audio
- **Now Playing integration** - Shows in Control Center and supports remote commands

### ðŸ“± Watch-Optimized Interface

- **Compact list view** - Shows video thumbnails, titles, and durations
- **Custom draggable slider** - Designed specifically for Apple Watch touch interaction
- **Visual feedback** - Thumbnail overlays with semi-transparent text backgrounds
- **One-handed operation** - Easy to use while running or exercising

### ðŸ”— Easy Content Management

- **Paste YouTube URLs** - Full URLs or just video IDs (e.g., `VDYbRBbAVak`)
- **Auto-refresh expired streams** - Automatically fetches new stream URLs when needed
- **Persistent storage** - Uses SwiftData to save your audio library
- **Swipe to delete** - Remove videos you no longer need

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

#### Models

- **`YouTubeAudioInfo`** - Decodes JSON response from your server
- **`YouTubeAudio`** - SwiftData model for persistent storage
- **`AudioStreamer`** - Handles AVPlayer, background audio, and Now Playing metadata

#### Views

- **`MainListView`** - Home screen with paste field and video list
- **`AudioPlayerView`** - Full-screen player with custom controls
- **`ThumbnailImage`** - Handles WebP fallback for YouTube thumbnails
- **`CustomSeekSlider`** - Watch-optimized draggable progress control

#### Services

- **`YouTubeAudioService`** - Fetches stream info from your server endpoint

### Key Features Implementation

#### Background Audio

```swift
// Configure for background playback
try session.setCategory(.playback, mode: .spokenAudio, options: [])
try session.setActive(true)
```

#### Custom Seek Slider

- Uses `DragGesture` with relative translation instead of absolute positioning
- Handles both tap-to-seek and drag-to-scrub interactions
- Accounts for thumb radius to prevent visual misalignment

#### Thumbnail Fallback

- Tries WebP URL first
- Falls back to JPEG variants (`maxresdefault.jpg`, `hqdefault.jpg`, `mqdefault.jpg`)
- Extracts video ID from original URL for fallback generation

## Server Requirements

The app requires a server endpoint that extracts YouTube audio stream information. I included in the repository the python script I used (yt_audio_info.py) for fetching this information:

### Required Tools on the Server

- `yt-dlp` (YouTube extractor)
- `ffmpeg` (recommended for muxing/remuxing and HLS support)

Install on macOS using Homebrew:

```bash
brew install yt-dlp ffmpeg
```

Install on Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y ffmpeg
python3 -m pip install --upgrade yt-dlp
```

### Endpoint

```
GET https://your-domain.com/cgi-bin/yt_audio_info.py?url={youtube_url}
```

### Expected Response

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "title": "Video Title",
  "uploader": "Channel Name",
  "duration": 966,
  "ext": "m4a",
  "stream_url": "https://...",
  "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/.../maxresdefault.jpg",
  "shortDescription": "Video description...",
  "expire_ts": 1758123253,
  "expire_human": "2025-09-17T16:34:13",
  "original_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...",
  "prefer_hls": false
}
```

### Server Setup

1. **HTTPS Required** - Apple requires secure connections for production
2. **Complete Certificate Chain** - Include intermediate certificates for proper TLS validation
3. **CORS Headers** - If needed for web-based testing

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- Xcode 15.0+
- watchOS 10.0+
- Apple Watch (Series 4 or later recommended)

### Build Steps

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `StreamSound.xcodeproj` in Xcode
3. Update the server endpoint in `YouTubeAudioService.swift`:
   ```swift
   private let baseEndpoint = "https://your-domain.com/cgi-bin/yt_audio_info.py"
   ```
4. Build and run on your Apple Watch

### Background Audio Setup

1. In Xcode, select your Watch app target
2. Go to **Signing & Capabilities**
3. Add **Background Modes**
4. Enable **Audio, AirPlay, and Picture in Picture**

## Usage

### Adding Videos

1. **Copy a YouTube URL** from your iPhone or any source
2. **Paste it** into the text field on the watch
3. **Tap the + button** to fetch and save the audio
4. **Alternative**: Just paste the video ID (11 characters) for faster entry

### Playing Audio

1. **Tap any video** in the list to open the player
2. **Tap play/pause** to control playback
3. **Drag the slider** to seek to any position
4. **Tap the slider** to jump to a specific time
5. **Use Control Center** for background controls

### Managing Your Library

- **Swipe left** on any video to delete it
- **Pull down** to refresh the list
- Videos are automatically saved and persist between app launches

## Customization

### Server Endpoint

Update the base URL in `YouTubeAudioService.swift`:

```swift
private let baseEndpoint = "https://your-server.com/endpoint"
```

### UI Adjustments

- **Thumbnail size**: Modify `.frame(width: 50, height: 50)` in `MainListView`
- **Slider appearance**: Adjust colors and sizing in `CustomSeekSlider`
- **Text styling**: Change fonts and colors throughout the views

### Audio Settings

- **Skip intervals**: Modify `preferredIntervals = [15]` in `AudioStreamer`
- **Buffer settings**: Adjust `addPeriodicTimeObserver` interval
- **Session category**: Change `.spokenAudio` to `.default` if needed

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "TLS error caused the secure connection to fail"

- Ensure your server has a complete SSL certificate chain
- Test with SSL Labs: https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/
- Check that intermediate certificates are included

#### Thumbnails not loading

- The app automatically falls back from WebP to JPEG
- Check that your server returns valid `thumbnail_url` values
- Verify network connectivity on the watch

#### Audio not playing in background

- Ensure Background Modes â†’ Audio is enabled
- Check that `AVAudioSession` is configured for `.playback`
- Verify the app has proper entitlements

#### Duration showing double

- The app prioritizes server-reported duration over AVFoundation
- Check that your server returns accurate duration values
- Debug with the console logs in `AudioStreamer`

### Debug Information

Enable debug logging by checking the console output:

- Duration loading: `DEBUG: Loaded duration: X seconds`
- Stream refresh: `DEBUG: Setting duration to X`
- Network errors: Check for HTTP status codes and error messages
